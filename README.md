<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT-->

## About the Project

The I Am Poor app is an app built with reference to the I Am Rich app. The I Am Rich app was an iOS app distributed to the App Store on Aug 05, 2008 by Armin Heinrich for $999.99, the highest price Apple allowed for App Store content. When launced, the screen only contained a glowing red gem and an icon that, when pressed, displayed the following mantra in large text: "I am rich"," I deserv it"," I am good", "healthy & successful". The app was removed from the App Store without explanation by Apple, the day after its release, Aug 06, 2008.

</p>

The I Am Poor app is a simple app that, once the button is pressed, the background color, image, and title change.

## What I learned

I Am Poor is the first app I have ever made. And from this app I have learned a lot, starting from designing an app icon, to using Xcode and Swift.
